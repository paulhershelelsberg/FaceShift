#Self Image Distortion 
##Final Project for Advanced Coding 

This project is meant to help people see themselves as beautiful for who they are beneath the masks of cultural status. It's important to continue developing self respect by realizing the distortion of happiness in common objectives of the american dream(beauty,money,power,popularity, and an attractive mate). Distortion increases overtime till a breaking point occurs and again we see ourselves removed from our fantasy.  There is a small icon display on the right side to navigate through modes and by replacing the spacebar the mask layer will be reset. This project also uses a basic perlin noise GL shader to distort the image over time.
